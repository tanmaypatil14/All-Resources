Why we dont go with SOAP?
ANS:
     1. In SOAP based web services we need xml based conversion.
     2. We need a registry to be maintained
     3. we need a SOAP request and SOAP response
     4. Everything goes in xml format, so this will be very very slow to process
  SO, this is the reasone we dont prefer to use with the SOAP based web services.
