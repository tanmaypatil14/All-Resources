Why we use serialVersionUID ?
ANS. =
           Suppose first we serialize the program it will gernerate txt file 
           AND then we deserialize the program it will read the txt file which 
           created earlier using same program.

           For to read and write the txt file SerialVersionUID plays major role.

           After serializing the program txt file is generated. And then we have
           done some updation is model class / POJO class. instead of again serializing
           we are directly deserialize the program and read the data from file,
           compiler sees that older and new UID are different then it will throw an
           exception.

           If we use UID instead of using default UID, whether we update the model class after
           serializaing it will able to read the txt file and it will not throw an exception.
